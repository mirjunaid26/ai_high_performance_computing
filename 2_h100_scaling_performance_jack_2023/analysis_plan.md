# H100 GPU Scaling Performance Analysis & Reproduction Plan

## Project Overview
Analyze NVIDIA H100 GPU scaling performance and reproduce key results on our cluster infrastructure.

## Phase 1: Document Analysis
- [ ] Extract key performance metrics from PDF
- [ ] Identify benchmark models and datasets used
- [ ] Document hardware configurations tested
- [ ] Note scaling patterns (1-GPU to multi-GPU performance)

## Phase 2: Environment Setup
- [ ] Inventory available H100 GPUs in cluster
- [ ] Set up containerized environment (Docker/Singularity)
- [ ] Install required deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- [ ] Configure CUDA toolkit and drivers
- [ ] Set up monitoring tools (nvidia-smi, nvtop, MLPerf tools)

## Phase 3: Benchmark Implementation
### Core Benchmarks to Reproduce:
- [ ] **ResNet-50** - Image classification scaling
- [ ] **BERT** - NLP model scaling  
- [ ] **GPT models** - Large language model scaling
- [ ] **Vision Transformer (ViT)** - Transformer scaling
- [ ] **Custom CNN architectures** - Domain-specific scaling

### Performance Metrics to Measure:
- [ ] Throughput (samples/sec, tokens/sec)
- [ ] Training time per epoch
- [ ] Memory utilization
- [ ] GPU utilization percentage
- [ ] Scaling efficiency (speedup vs ideal)
- [ ] Power consumption

## Phase 4: Scaling Experiments
- [ ] Single GPU baseline performance
- [ ] 2-GPU scaling (NVLink performance)
- [ ] 4-GPU scaling 
- [ ] 8-GPU scaling (if available)
- [ ] Multi-node scaling (if cluster supports)

## Phase 5: Analysis & Reporting
- [ ] Compare results with published benchmarks
- [ ] Identify performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Generate scaling efficiency charts
- [ ] Document cluster-specific optimizations
- [ ] Create reproduction report
